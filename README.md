This is the repo for the Clash Royale Analytics Web App, formerly known as Competition Clash.  
  
*What is it?*  
This web application was originally intended to be a place where players could elect to have their data collected and aggregated to show them which cards they tend to do well against, and overall statistics per deck they use. I also used the data to build various content recommendation systems and made them available in the app.  
  
*Why did the app get discontinued?*  
I have taken down the app because I no longer wish to maintain the web portion of this project, as I originally wanted to create various recommendation systems. Further, turns out it's really difficult to get users! It's not enough to build a great product. There are other, more well-known apps for Clash Royale players and I did not want to spend my time constantly creating content and attracting new users. With the additional knowledge that I couldn't easily monetize the site's insights due to API restrictions, it was clear that my time would be better spent elsewhere.  
 
*So what's the plan for Competition Clash?*  
For now, it will live here. I've since partnered with [RoyaleAPI](https://royaleapi.com/) to help them improve their offering to users.
